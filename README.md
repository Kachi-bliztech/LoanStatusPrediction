<h1>Loan Eligibility Prediction System</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project Overview:
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether an individual is eligible for a loan based on their application data. The solution aims to support financial institutions in automating the loan approval process, improving decision-making efficiency, and reducing manual intervention.

Problem Statement:
A financial company offers loans to clients and wants to streamline the approval process by determining loan eligibility automatically. Clients complete an online application form, and based on the submitted details (such as income, employment status, credit history, and loan amount), the company needs to assess whether the applicant qualifies for a loan.

Model Approach:
- <b>Collected and explored a dataset containing various applicant features and corresponding loan eligibility outcomes</b> 
- </b>Preprocessed the data:
Handled missing values and outliers
-Encoded categorical variables
-Scaled numerical features </b>
- </b>Built a classification model using algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.</b>
- </b>Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports to ensure predictive reliability.</b>
<br />


<h2>Skills </h2>

- <b>Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn)</b>
- <b>Data preprocessing and feature engineering</b>
- <b>Classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine)</b>
- <b>Model evaluation metrics </b>



<h2>Outcomes </h2>

- <b>A trained Logistic Regression model that enables real-time identification of underwater objects based on sonar data, thereby enhancing submarine navigation and safety by avoiding potential threats.</b>
